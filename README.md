# Panda Guide App

### What it is

Panda Guide App gathers resources to save students of the UT Coding Bootcamp time. It helps students spend less time searching for resources and more time learning. Panda provides useful links to videos, various posts and PDF documents directly related to the technology stack taught by the UT Coding Bootcamp. It also gives students filtered job searches based on location (Austin, TX), technologies studied, and, as the jobs APIs provide, entry-level or junior positions.
